## Recent Stuff

Started a bunch of things, finished fewer than I'd like. Working on that.

Currently interviewing, exploring co-founder opportunities, and trying to figure out how to build something that generates a couple hundred k without burning out.

## Background

Canadian, moved to Seattle in 2021. Built Chrome extensions, AI systems at enterprise scale, and various tools that scratch my own itches. I like projects that are technically interesting but are more importantly USEFUL, even if I don't always finish them.

## Stack

Python • TypeScript • JavaScript • React • AI/ML • Full-stack

## Philosophy

Build things that solve problems I actually have. Ship fast, polish later (or never). Prefer authentic communication over corporate speak.
